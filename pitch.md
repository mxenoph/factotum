In 2019, 5.3% of employed people in the EU usually worked from home and over 10% reported that sometimes did. 

During the COVID19 pandemic and the lockdown policies adopted by many countries, those numbers have increased many fold. 
To stay safe we stay home, but that imposes many challenges. Factotum Careâ€™s mission is to help employees work better from home.
